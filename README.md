# Modern C++ for the Windows Runtime
Modern is a Standard C++ language projection for the Windows Runtime. The Modern compiler produces a header-only library designed to provide Standard C++ developers with first-class access to the modern Windows API.

## Update
Modern is now called C++/WinRT and is included in the Windows SDK. Read [all about it here](http://moderncpp.com/).

This historical repository contains the libraries produced by the original Modern compiler for the following targets. Each library contains a set of sample projects to get you started.
